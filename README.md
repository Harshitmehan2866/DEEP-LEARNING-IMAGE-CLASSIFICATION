Objective

To implement a deep learning model using PyTorch or TensorFlow. Perform image classification or natural language processing (NLP). Train, test, and visualize a functional deep learning pipeline. Deliver a working model along with visual output (graph/image).


Tools & Libraries Used

1. Language: Python 3.x
2. Deep Learning Framework: PyTorch
3. Dataset: CIFAR-10 (via torchvision.datasets)


Libraries:

1. torch – neural network training
2. torchvision – datasets & transforms
3. matplotlib – plotting prediction results
4. numpy – data manipulation

Platform & Editor


1. Code Editor: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
2. Execution Environment: Local machine (Windows/Linux/Mac)
3. Terminal: VS Code integrated terminal with Python interpreter
4. Version Control: GitHub (for submission and documentation)


Model Summary

1. Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
2. Layers: 2 convolutional layers (with ReLU activation)
MaxPooling layers
Fully connected (dense) layers
Loss Function: CrossEntropyLoss
3. Optimizer: Adam (adaptive learning rate)
4. Epochs: 5
5. Batch Size: 32


Output & Deliverables

1. image_classification.py: Full training and prediction script
2. cifar_net.pth: Saved trained model weights
3. result_plot.png: Image showing model predictions on test data
4. Console Output: Training loss per epoch + final accuracy report


Sample Output Preview

Test Accuracy: ~60–70%
result_plot.png: Shows 4 predicted CIFAR-10 images with actual and predicted class labels
